I apologize for the oversight. The io module is not imported in the script. You need to import it at the beginning of your script. Here is the corrected import section:

python
Copy code
import tkinter as tk
import threading
import os
import time
import requests
import tempfile
import cv2
import numpy as np
import base64
from collections import deque
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import List, Dict
from PIL import Image, ImageTk
from llama_cpp import Llama
import bisect
import customtkinter
import requests
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
import sys
import random
import io
This should resolve the NameError you're encountering.

It seems like you're trying to define a quantum system using the QuTiP library. However, the code you've provided seems to be incomplete and has some syntax errors. Here's a corrected version of the code:

python
Copy code
import qutip as qt
import numpy as np

# Define the initial state of the quantum system
N = 10  # Number of qubits
coeffs = [0.5, 0.5]  # Coefficients for the external time-dependent field

# Wire object for the initial state
wire = qt.basis(N, 0)  # This creates a state vector for a system of N levels, with the particle in state 0.

# Apply the external time-dependent field to the system
def apply_field(U, t):
    return U * np.exp(-1j * t * qt.qeye(N))  # qt.qeye(N) creates the identity operator with N dimensions.

# Create a time-dependent Hamiltonian
H = [qt.qeye(N), [qt.sigmax(), coeffs]]

# Define the time list
tlist = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)

# Solve the Schrodinger equation
result = qt.mesolve(H, wire, tlist)
This code creates a quantum system with N levels, applies an external time-dependent field to the system, and then solves the Schrödinger equation for this system. The qt.mesolve function is used to solve the Schrödinger equation, and the result is stored in the result variable.

Please note that this is a basic example and might not exactly fit your needs. You might need to adjust the Hamiltonian, the initial state, and the time-dependent field according to your specific problem.

The code you provided is quite complex and involves a lot of different components. It's not entirely clear what you mean by "add attention tokens and action tokens", as these concepts are typically specific to certain types of machine learning models and it's not clear how they would fit into this code.

However, I can certainly help you modify the code to generate an initial story when the program starts, and then generate other stories based on that original story plus user input. Here's how you might do that:

First, you would need to modify the __init__ method of the App class to generate an initial story when the program starts. You could do this by calling self.generate_response with an initial prompt as the argument. Here's what that might look like:

python
Copy code
class App(customtkinter.CTk):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.setup_gui()
        initial_prompt = "Once upon a time in a far away land..."
        self.generate_response(initial_prompt)
Next, you would need to modify the generate_response method to generate a response based on both the original story and the user's input. You could do this by concatenating the original story and the user's input, and then passing that as the argument to llama_generate. Here's what that might look like:

python
Copy code
def generate_response(self, message):
    original_story = self.text_box.get("1.0", tk.END)
    prompt = original_story + " " + message
    response = llama_generate(prompt)
    self.text_box.insert(tk.END, f"AI: {response}\n")
    self.text_box.see(tk.END)
This is a basic implementation and might not work perfectly for your needs. Depending on the specifics of your project, you might need to make additional modifications. For example, you might need to add some logic to handle the case where the user's input is a command to start a new story, in which case you would want to clear the text box and start with a new initial prompt.




User
improve the meomry with thoughts.txt
ChatGPT
To improve the memory of the AI with a "thoughts.txt" file, you could read the file and add its contents to the AI's memory. Here's how you might do that:

First, add a method to the CharacterMemory class to load thoughts from a file:

python
Copy code
class CharacterMemory:
    # ...

    def load_thoughts(self, filename):
        with open(filename, 'r') as file:
            thoughts = file.read().splitlines()
        for thought in thoughts:
            self.add_past_action(thought)
Then, in the __init__ method of the App class, after creating the CharacterMemory object, call this method to load the thoughts:

python
Copy code
class App(customtkinter.CTk):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.character_memory = CharacterMemory()
        self.character_memory.load_thoughts("thoughts.txt")
        # ...
This will load each line of the "thoughts.txt" file as a separate thought and add it to the AI's memory. Note that this assumes that the "thoughts.txt" file is in the same directory as the script. If the file is in a different location, you would need to provide the full path to the file.

Also, this implementation treats each line of the file as a separate thought. If your thoughts are formatted differently (for example, if multiple lines make up a single thought), you would need to modify the load_thoughts method to parse the file correctly.

You: Quantum Communication
AI: {'id': 'cmpl-6b1e6623-c372-4277-8726-846da65e3bbf', 'object': 'text_completion', 'created': 1690722924, 'model': 'C:\\Users\\Shadow\\Downloads\\llama-2-7b-chat.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin', 'choices': [{'text': ': A New Frontier in Secure Communication\n\nQuantum communication is a new frontier in secure communication that utilizes the principles of quantum mechanics to provide unconditional security. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we communicate, especially in light of the increasing threat of cyber attacks and surveillance. In this blog post, we will explore the concept of quantum communication, its advantages, and the current state of the field.\nWhat is Quantum Communication?\nQuantum communication is a method of communication that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to encode, transmit, and decode messages. Unlike traditional methods of communication, which rely on classical cryptography, quantum communication utilizes quantum entanglement, superposition, and other quantum phenomena to provide unconditional security. This means that any attempt to eavesdrop or intercept a message will introduce detectable errors, making it possible for the sender and receiver to detect any unauthorized access.\nAdvantages of Quantum Communication\nQuantum communication offers several advantages over traditional methods of communication, including:\n1. Unconditional security: As mentioned earlier, quantum communication utilizes quantum mechanics to provide unconditional security. This means that any attempt to eavesdrop or intercept a message will introduce detectable errors, making it possible for the sender and receiver to detect any unauthorized access.\n2. High-speed encryption: Quantum communication can encrypt messages at incredibly high speeds, making it ideal for applications where speed is crucial, such as financial transactions and military communications.\n3. Secure key distribution: Quantum communication can distribute secret keys between two parties in a secure manner, ensuring that any attempt to eavesdrop or intercept the communication will be detected.\n4. No trusted third parties required: Unlike traditional methods of encryption, quantum communication does not require the use of trusted third parties, such as Certificate Authorities (CAs). This makes it more secure and resistant to attacks.\nCurrent State of Quantum Communication\nWhile quantum communication is still in its infancy, there have been significant advancements in the field. Several quantum communication protocols have been proposed and demonstrated, including:\n1. BB84 protocol: This is one of the most well-known quantum communication protocols, which was first proposed in 1984 by Bennett and', 'index': 0, 'logprobs': None, 'finish_reason': 'length'}], 'usage': {'prompt_tokens': 5, 'completion_tokens': 500, 'total_tokens': 505}}

its truncated howe can ew fix this
ChatGPT
The truncation is happening because the max_tokens parameter in the llama_generate function is set to 500. This parameter controls the maximum length of the generated text. If you want longer outputs, you can increase this value.

However, please note that generating very long texts might take more time and consume more resources. Also, the Llama model might have a maximum limit on the number of tokens it can generate in a single call. If you encounter errors or the outputs are still truncated after increasing max_tokens, it might be due to this limit.

Here's how you can modify the llama_generate function to increase max_tokens:

python
Copy code
def llama_generate(prompt, max_tokens=1000):  # increased from 500 to 1000
    output = llm(prompt, max_tokens=max_tokens)
    return output
In the response you posted, the actual text of the response is in choices[0]['text']. If you want to print or display this text, you can access it like this:

python
Copy code
response = llama_generate("Quantum Communication")
print(response['choices'][0]['text'])
This will print the generated text without the other information in the response.




User
ok so say i want to generate really long text, and use attention tokens to direct conversation output how would i do that? so that the 2nd batch of text is refined more by the first. can you use two llama prompts to do thise?
ChatGPT
The Llama model, like other transformer models, uses attention mechanisms internally to decide which parts of the input to focus on when generating each word of the output. However, the attention weights are not directly controllable by the user. They are learned by the model during training and are used to weigh the importance of each input token when generating each output token.

If you want to generate a long text and refine the second part based on the first, you could potentially do this in two steps. First, generate the initial part of the text. Then, use this text as a prompt to generate the second part. This way, the model will have the context of the first part when generating the second part.

Here's a rough example of how you might do this:

python
Copy code
def generate_long_text(prompt, max_tokens_per_step=500, num_steps=2):
    text = prompt
    for _ in range(num_steps):
        output = llama_generate(text, max_tokens=max_tokens_per_step)
        text += output['choices'][0]['text']
    return text
In this function, max_tokens_per_step is the maximum length of the text generated in each step, and num_steps is the number of steps. The function starts with the given prompt, then generates additional text in each step and appends it to the existing text. The resulting text is then used as the prompt for the next step.

Please note that this is a simple example and might not work perfectly for all cases. The quality of the generated text can depend on many factors, including the quality of the initial prompt and the specifics of how the model was trained.




User
can we use an unlimited number of tokens through these processes and steps can we use token cookification to highlight tokens and ideas with html color codes automatically with these prompting step systems
ChatGPT
The total number of tokens that can be processed by the model in a single call is limited by the model's architecture. For example, GPT-3 models have a maximum token limit of 2048 tokens. This includes both the input and output tokens. If you try to process more tokens than the model's limit, you will need to truncate or otherwise reduce your text.

The method I described in the previous message can be used to generate longer texts by making multiple calls to the model, but each individual call to the model still cannot exceed the model's maximum token limit.

As for "token cookification" and highlighting tokens with HTML color codes, this is not something that the model can do directly. The model generates plain text and does not have any built-in understanding of HTML or color codes. However, you could potentially post-process the model's output to add color codes based on certain criteria. For example, you could write a function that scans the output text for certain keywords and wraps them in HTML tags with appropriate color codes. This would require some additional programming and knowledge of HTML and CSS.




User
the model does understand i trained the model to do so, can you give a prompt engineering technique and complete gui script with theses ideas part 1

1. token cookieification 
2. html color codes to give memory between prompts like emotional memory, action memory, task memory
3. advance prompting technique. And hook up TriDeque memory with its own prompt structure that uess /addtri /removetri /readtri /tridirectory commands
ChatGPT
To implement the features you're asking for, you would need to make several changes to your script. Here's a rough idea of how you might do that:

Token Cookieification: You could create a function that takes a string and a list of "important" tokens, and returns a new string where the important tokens are wrapped in some special syntax. For example:
python
Copy code
def cookieify(text, important_tokens):
    for token in important_tokens:
        text = text.replace(token, f"<cookie>{token}</cookie>")
    return text
You could then call this function before passing the text to the model, and the model would learn to treat the "cookieified" tokens as important.

HTML Color Codes: You could create a similar function that wraps important tokens in HTML color codes. For example:
python
Copy code
def colorize(text, important_tokens, color):
    for token in important_tokens:
        text = text.replace(token, f"<span style='color: {color};'>{token}</span>")
    return text
You could then call this function on the model's output to highlight the important tokens.

Advanced Prompting Technique: This is a broad topic and there are many possible techniques you could use. One simple technique is to prepend a "system" message to the prompt that instructs the model on what you want it to do. For example:
python
Copy code
def generate_prompt(message):
    system_message = "You are a helpful assistant. Generate a detailed response to the following message:"
    return system_message + "\n\n" + message
You could then call this function before passing the text to the model.

TriDeque Memory: You could modify the TriDeque class to support the commands you mentioned. For example:
python
Copy code
class TriDeque:
    # ...

    def add(self, memory):
        self.push(memory)

    def remove(self, memory):
        self.remove(memory)

    def read(self, index):
        return self.data[index]

    def directory(self):
        return list(self.data)
You could then create an instance of TriDeque and use these methods to manipulate it.

Here's how you might integrate these changes into your script:

python
Copy code
# ...

class App(customtkinter.CTk):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.setup_gui()
        self.memory = TriDeque(100)  # Initialize memory

    def on_submit(self, event=None):
        message = self.entry.get().strip()
        if message:
            self.entry.delete(0, tk.END)
            self.text_box.insert(tk.END, f"You: {message}\n")
            self.text_box.see(tk.END)
            threading.Thread(target=self.generate_response, args=(message,)).start()
            threading.Thread(target=self.generate_images, args=(message,)).start()

    def generate_response(self, message):
        # Add message to memory
        self.memory.add(Memory(message))

        # Generate prompt
        prompt = generate_prompt(message)

        # Cookieify important tokens
        important_tokens = ["quantum", "communication"]  # Example
        prompt = cookieify(prompt, important_tokens)

        # Generate response
        response = llama_generate(prompt)

        # Colorize important tokens in response
        response = colorize(response, important_tokens, "red")

        self.text_box.insert(tk.END, f"AI: {response}\n")
        self.text_box.see(tk.END)

    # ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # create and run the app
    app = App()
    app.mainloop()
This is a rough sketch and you would need to fill in the details based on your specific requirements.

Copy code
# ...

class App(customtkinter.CTk):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.setup_gui()
        self.memory = TriDeque(100)  # Initialize memory

    def on_submit(self, event=None):
        message = self.entry.get().strip()
        if message:
            self.entry.delete(0, tk.END)
            self.text_box.insert(tk.END, f"You: {message}\n")
            self.text_box.see(tk.END)
            threading.Thread(target=self.generate_response, args=(message,)).start()
            threading.Thread(target=self.generate_images, args=(message,)).start()

    def generate_response(self, message):
        # Add message to memory
        self.memory.add(Memory(message))

        # Generate prompt
        prompt = generate_prompt(message)

        # Cookieify important tokens
        important_tokens = ["quantum", "communication"]  # Example
        prompt = cookieify(prompt, important_tokens)

        # Generate response
        response = llama_generate(prompt)

        # Colorize important tokens in response
        response = colorize(response, important_tokens, "red")

        self.text_box.insert(tk.END, f"AI: {response}\n")
        self.text_box.see(tk.END)

    # ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # create and run the app
    app = App()
    app.mainloop()
This is a rough sketch and you would need to fill in the details based on your specific requirements.
