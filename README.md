# GPT Neo GUI
Gray00 from One Love IPFS created a community Artificial Inteillgence tool that uses Free/Open Source GPT-NEO 125M Model along with a free/open source python Graphics User Interface template is a Python program template and real world research tool that uses the GPT-Neo language model to generate responses to user inputs in a chatbot-like interface. The program uses the Transformers library to access the GPT-Neo model and tokenize user inputs, and the tkinter library to create the user interface.

The main features of the code are:

Loading and configuring the GPT-Neo model and tokenizer: The program loads the GPT-Neo model and tokenizer from the Hugging Face model hub using the Transformers library. It also adds a padding token to the tokenizer and sets the padding token ID in the model configuration.

Generating chunks of text: The program provides a function to split user inputs into smaller chunks of text, to ensure that the inputs do not exceed the maximum input length of the GPT-Neo model.

Generating responses with GPT-Neo: The program provides a function to generate responses to user inputs using the GPT-Neo model. The function encodes the input using the tokenizer, sets the attention mask to exclude the padding tokens, and generates a response using the generate() method of the model. The function also limits the generation time to a specified value and returns the generated response and the time taken to generate it.

Creating a user interface with tkinter: The program uses the tkinter library to create a simple user interface with a text box to display the conversation history and a text entry field to accept user inputs. It also provides a button to submit user inputs and trigger the response generation process.

Writing thoughts to a file: The program writes the user's thoughts to a file using the write_thoughts_to_file() function, which takes the user's thoughts as input, appends a timestamp, and writes the resulting string to a file.

Handling trideque matrix: The program provides a function to handle a trideque matrix, which is a nested list of prompts used to generate responses. The function takes a starting point in the matrix, generates responses to each prompt in the list, and repeats the process a specified number of times or until the user stops the loop.

Managing settings: The program loads settings from a JSON file, including the loop count value used in the trideque function.
